### Loops summary

Using loops we can run a certain block of code over and over for as many times as we want up until some condition has been satisfied or we can have it running (looping) forever - we usually refer to this as an infinite loop.

In javascript and most other programming languages there are diffirent types of loops that all fundamentally do the same thing - repeat the execution of some block of code over and over again.

The main ones that we will be focusing on are the following:

- while loop
- do while loop
- for loop

Note that there are other types of loops besides the aforementioned but a solid understanding of these three will suffice for now.

#### while loop

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // code you want to run repeatedly
}
```

#### do while loop

```javascript
do {
  // code you want to run repeatedly
} while (condition)
```

#### for loop

```javascript
for(initialization, condition, increment) {
  // code you want to run repeatedly
}
```

### That's it, for now!

That's all for now but there's still so much more to come. So until then I just want to thank you for stopping by and if you have any questions please never hesitate to contact me. Remember, you can always send your questions to my email @ rodgetech@gmail.com
