### Operators summary

In programming world, operators are reserved symbols that you can use to perform mathematical or logical operations. You can use them for arithmetic or for checking if a variable is equal to a value or to another variable and much more of course.

The following are the common types of operators that you will usually be working with:

#### Arithmetic

We can use arithmetic operators to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

| Symbol | Operation      | Usage  | Details               |
| ------ | -------------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| +      | addition       | x + y  | add `y` to `x`        |
| -      | subtraction    | x - y  | subtract `y` from `x` |
| \*     | multiplication | x \* y | multiply `x` with `y` |
| /      | division       | x / y  | divide `x` by `y`     |

#### Assignment

You already saw one example of this in the previous section where we went over variables - that is assigning a value to a variable. We have a few more assignment operators than just the `=` one.

| Symbol | Operation               | Usage   | Same as    | Details                                                |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| =      | assignment              | x = y   |            | assignes whatever value is in `y` to `x`               |
| +=     | add and assignment      | x += y  | x = x + y  | assignes to `x` the result of adding `x` to `y`        |
| -=     | minus and assignment    | x -= y  | x = x - y  | assignes to `x` the result of minusing `x` from `y`    |
| \*=    | multiply and assignment | x \*= y | x = x \* y | assignes to `x` the result of multiplying `x` with `y` |
| /=     | divide and assignment   | x /= y  | x = x / y  | assignes to `x` the result of dividing `x` by `y`      |

### That's it, for now!

That's all for now but there's still so much more to come. So until then I just want to thank you for stopping by and if you have any questions please never hesitate to contact me. Remember, you can always send your questions to my email @ rodgetech@gmail.com
